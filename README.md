# Bike Data Register

Storing and reading user log of bike usage.<br/>
Data stored using firebase.<br>
You can upload data when a bike is being taken and also the current reading of the odometer. This will help in calculating the fuel cost incurred during that journey.

## Future Goals
- Add a calculator option which displays the cost incurred per ride, as well as mileage.
- Add option to edit and delete records added by current user in the last 15 minutes.
- Improve UI and UX.
- Allow users to create their own databases.
